# python-challenge
PyBank and PyPoll App challenges. Each are in their own folder. 

GPT-4 was used partially in this project; output from the LLM (Large Language Model) will indicated by the citation style below this paragraph. Note that as these tools are quite new, the format for citations may evolve to reflect updated needs or context. I will do my best to create an obvious visual distinction between GPT-4, and my own hand-typed notes and code.

I've decided to place the original instructions for this challenge project in a different file, located at `python-challenge\misc-files\docs\original-challenge-instructions.md` to keep the main README clean.
